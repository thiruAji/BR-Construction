FIREBASE STORAGE SECURITY RULES - Copy this to Firebase Console

Go to: Firebase Console > construction-da7de > Storage > Rules

Replace all content with this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    
    // Receipts folder - authenticated users can upload and download their receipts
    match /receipts/{siteId}/{rowId}/{fileName} {
      // Allow authenticated users to read (download) all receipts
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow authenticated users to create (upload) receipts
      // Limit file size to 10MB for images
      allow create: if request.auth != null &&
                      request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024 &&
                      request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*|application/pdf');
      
      // Allow update/delete only if the user who uploaded it
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Deny all other access by default
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Make sure Storage is ENABLED in Firebase Console
2. The default rules in Firebase are very restrictive
3. Copy the rules EXACTLY as shown above
4. After pasting, click "Publish" button
5. Wait for rules to be deployed (usually takes 30 seconds)

If uploads are still failing:
- Check Firebase Console > Storage > Files to see if images were uploaded
- Check browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
- Verify authentication token is valid
